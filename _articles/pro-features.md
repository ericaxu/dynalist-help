#### Automatic daily backup

Pro users can link their Dropbox and Google Drive account, and every day a full backup will be sent to it. To link your Dropbox or Google Drive, open Settings and go to the "Dynalist Pro" tab.

#### Custom shortcuts

Pro users can customize keyboard shortcuts to better suit their workflow. See [here](../custom-shortcuts/) for how.

#### Google Calendar integration

Dynalist Pro gives you the ability to sync the dates in Dynalist to your Google Calendar.

To do so, first go to Settings and switch to the "Dynalist Pro" tab. In the "Google Calendar integration" section, there's a button to link your Google Calendar account.

After it's successfully linked, there are two more things to set up in order for the sync to start working:

1. Choose a calendar to sync to. Go to the same "Google Calendar integration" section in Settings and choose "Choose calendar to sync to". A list of your calendars will be fetched and displayed in a dropdown menu. Simply choose the one you want to sync dates to.
2. Right click on the documents whose dates you want to sync, and choose "Turn on Google Calendar sync".

After the above steps, Dynalist will start syncing the dates in these selected documents in the background to your Google Calendar.

#### Priority support

We answer feedback and requests from Pro users first to thank you for the generous support.
